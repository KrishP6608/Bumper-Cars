# Bumper-Cars
This is a game I made on the CMU Academy platform. It has two teams blue and red that are playing bumper cars. You can control the car with WASD or arrow keys. There is a timer on top that shows you who is on the offense. 
Being on offense means that if you hit the other car you will win the game. There are red and green squares that decrease or increase your speed. If you go off the screen you will wrap back in from the other side.
